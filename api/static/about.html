    <h1>About this Solution</h1>
    <p>This solution is designed to help you manage your IP addresses in Azure Virtual Network. It provides a way to view your existing subnets and find a suitable IP range for new subnets based on your required number of IP addresses.</p>
    <h2>How does this differs from existing Subnet Calculators?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://visualsubnetcalc.com/">Existing Subnet Calculators</a> are often designed to spit and join subnets based on network address and network size. This requires some basic network split and joining knowledge.</p>
    <p>This solution is designed to be more user-friendly and is designed to be used by people who may not have a deep understanding of networking. It is designed for simplicity by just asking the required number of IP addresses for which you want the subnet to be created.</p>
    <p>And this solution takes into account the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-faq#are-there-any-restrictions-on-using-ip-addresses-within-these-subnets">Azure reserved IP addresses</a>. Azure reserves the first four addresses and the last address, for a total of five IP addresses within each subnet.</p>
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>This solution is designed to work with IPv4 addresses only. The smallest supported IPv4 subnet is /29 (8 IP addresses), and the largest is /16 (65536 IP addresses)</p>
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p><b>Why are you using Copilot in the name of the solution? Does it uses any Artificial Intelligence?</b></p></li>
      <p>No the only Artificial Intelligence being used is during the development of the tool using some help from Github Copilot.</p>
      <p>It was just me being funny because nowadays it seems that all new solutions have some kind of Artificial Intelligence added on.</p>
      <li><p><b>Is this an official tool from Microsoft?</b></p></li>
      <p>No this is just something I developed in my free time because I've seen (Microsoft) customers sometimes having challenges to find the right Azure Subnet Ranges</p>
      <li><p><b>Why is this not hosted in Azure?</b></p></li>
      <p>Because this is a personal project. I looked for options that would minimize the costs for hosting this solution. I might migrate this project in the future to Azure if I see advantages of hosting it there.</p>
      <li><p><b>Can I host this solution within my own environment?</b></p></li>
      <p>Yes you can host this solution in your own environment. You can get all the code used to deploy this solution <a href="https://github.com/stefanstranger/AzureSubnetCopilot">here</a>.</p>
      <li><p><b>Which data is being collected by the online version?</b></p></li>
      <p><a href="https://vercel.com/docs/analytics">Vercels' Web Analytics data</a> is being collected.</p>
      <p>And the values returned for the suggested subnet ip range</p>
      <p>E.g. Suggested subnet: 10.0.0.144/29 with size: 8 smallest_subnet: 29 required_ips: 8 total_ips_in_existing_cidrs: 152 total_ips_in_cidr: 256).</p>
      <p> These logs are kept for a maximum of 1 hour for troubleshooting.</p>
