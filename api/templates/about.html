    <h1>About this Solution</h1>
    <p>This solution is designed to help you manage your IP addresses in Azure Virtual Network. It provides a way to view your existing subnets and find a suitable IP range for new subnets based on your required number of IP addresses.</p>
    <h2>How does this differs from existing Subnet Calculators?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://visualsubnetcalc.com/">Existing Subnet Calculators</a> are often designed to spit and join subnets based on network address and network size. This requires some basic network split and joining knowledge.</p>
    <p>This solution is designed to be more user-friendly and is designed to be used by people who may not have a deep understanding of networking. It is designed for simplicity by just asking the required number of IP addresses for which you want the subnet to be created.</p>
    <p>And this solution takes into account the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-faq#are-there-any-restrictions-on-using-ip-addresses-within-these-subnets">Azure reserved IP addresses</a>. Azure reserves the first four addresses and the last address, for a total of five IP addresses within each subnet.</p>
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>This solution is designed to work with IPv4 addresses only. The smallest supported IPv4 subnet is /29 (8 IP addresses), and the largest is /16 (65536 IP addresses)</p>
